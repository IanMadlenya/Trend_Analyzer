  Our project focuses on two research questions. 
  
  Our first question is whether Google Trends data accurately reflects the unemployment and inflation rates in the world. Our second question is whether the Phillips Curve (which states that decreased unemployment in an economy will correlate with higher rates of inflation) is accurate about the inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment. 
  At first our data focused on the top 4 countries that google search "unemployment" the most. These countries are the United States, Canada, South Africa, and Ireland. Due to the lack of data on Ireland's inflation, we chose the sixth country that google searches "unemployment" the most--New Zealand. Nigeria, being the fifth highest country, was also an option, but we chose not to analyze it due to insufficient data. 
  Our data now focuses on these four countries--United States, Canada, South Africa, and New Zealand. We limited our data to years 2006 to 2013 as these years contained the most data.
  
  The authors of this project are Audrey Webb (Sophomore, intended Statistics), Victor Yoolim Jin (Junior, Economics, intended Statistics), Arion Thai (Junior, intended Statistics), and Mehma Bhasin (Senior, Math). 
  
  We organized our data according to the final project instructions creating code, data, images, rawdata, report, and resources subdirectories of the Project directory. Inside of the data and rawdata subdirectories, we created two new subdirectories titled "Google" and "World Bank". Inside of each, we created two separate folders titled "Inflation" and "Unemployment". This kept our data organized as we cleaned and analyzed it. For example, the raw data concerning the United States Google Trends on inflation would go into the rawdata subdirectory, then the "Google" folder, and then the "Inflation" folder.

  We give license for our code to be shared.
